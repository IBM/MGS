//
// This file specifies a timer class.  The purpose of this class is to
// permit the programmer to measure the amount of system time which is
// spent during particular phases of a program.  The general model for
// this timer class was taken from _A Computer Science Tapestry_ by
// Owen Astrachan, McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-005997-7.
//
// The basic model of the class is that of a stop watch which has two
// buttons.  One button is used to toggle the stop watch between the
// "recording" and "idle" states and the other button is used to reset
// the stop watch.
//
// Concerning units:  All times are given in units of seconds returned
// as a double.
//
// The class is based in the C library function clock(), which returns
// the number of ticks of the system clock since the program started,
// where the system constant CLOCKS_PER_SEC specifies the number of
// ticks per second.  This constant determines the smallest time
// differential which can be measured, ranging from a few microseconds
// to more than a hundredth of a second.  This smallest time difference
// is returned by the function granularity.
//
// On some systems the constant CLK_TCK may be used instead of
// instead of CLOCKS_PER_SEC, in which case the line after the
// includes should be uncommented.
