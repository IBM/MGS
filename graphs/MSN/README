In this folder, the model for MSN is developped

There will be two models we target: D1-type and D2-type

** COMMON

A .swc file will be used 
To generate the synapses, we develop a synapse_gen.py code 
that randomly generate the synapse on every branch of the MSN.

METHOD: each synapse is represented by a small neuron, and then we need to use
a tissue file, that lists a 'real' MSN + thousands of 'bouton' neuron


* D1-type



* D2-type
