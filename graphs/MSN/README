In this folder, the model for MSN is developped

There will be two models we target: D1-type and D2-type

** COMMON

A .swc file will be used 
To generate the synapses, we develop a synapse_gen.py code 
that randomly generate the synapse on every branch of the MSN.

METHOD: each synapse is represented by a small neuron, and then we need to use
a tissue file, that lists a 'real' MSN + thousands of 'bouton' neuron


* D1-type



* D2-type

CURRENT STATUS: 
 We first test by blocking diffusion, and inject the same currrent into the system
 Erev K+ = -80mV is important for the Wolf 2005 behavior
 Something wrong with Na+ model, so I'm testing using Nat from Hay2011 model

===============================================================
MORPHOLOGY
  The name will be used by ./changemorph.sh script 
  | ----name-----|----explaination----|
     d1d2         'computerized' MSN no spines
     msn0         'computerized' MSN with spines from Klapstein - ... - Michael Levine (2001)

  NOTE: There can be different 'resolution' for one morphology, e.g. number of data points
  E.g. 
  neurons_msn0/MSN_denda0_1180.swc  (1180  data points) with spines
  neurons_msn0/MSN_denda0.swc       (594   data points) with spines
  neurons_msn0/MSN_denda0_1180nospine.swc  (1180  data points) no spines

===============================================================
SIMULATION

Step 1: untar the spines data (if use)

Step 2: choose the morphology
./changemorph <morph-name>


Step 3: unblock input (axonal terminal) if needed

Step 4: run the simulation
./extractMacros.sh
