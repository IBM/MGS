traub51: Traub-Miles (1995)
   46 compartments for soma-dend; 
    5 compartments for axon


Network: 384 neurons laid out on 96x4 arrays
  - Traub 1999 - describe network synaptic connectivity
4 types of interneurons: not different in electro-physiol. properties
     - different in connection patterns to pyramidal cells
 (basket cells
  axon-axonic cells
  interneurons type 1 : contact den of pyramidal cells
  interneurons type 2 : contact den of pyramidal cells
 )

connection patterns:
  random between 2 interneurons within 25 units (i.e. 500 um), i.e. each unit 20 um
  along axis of array
  one interneuron has exactly 20 inputs from basket cell; 40 inputs from interneurons (i.e. 20 from each of the two types via den-contacting)


NOTE: The formula for [Ca2+] dynamics is different from that of Traub 
  which makes the change to Ca-dependency formula in BK channel
